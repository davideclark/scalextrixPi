# scalextrixPi
This project allow you to control a Micro Scalextrix set using a Raspberry Pi.
The Micro Scalextrix I used is a 'My First Scalextrix' which contain 2 DC controlled car.
It is possible to control the speed of the car using a Pulse Width Modulated Signal, generated on one of the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, via a ULN2003AN High-Voltage, High-Current Darlington Transistor Array chip.
